            <h1>Problems with <span class="bold">Extracurricular Activities</span> in students' lives</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>What are extracurricular activities?</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">Extracurricular activities</span> are activities, performed by students,<br>
             that falls outside the realm of the normal curriculum of school, college or university education. <br>
             Such activities are generally voluntary (as opposed to mandatory), social, philanthropic,<br>
             and often involve others of the same age.
            </p>

            <p>The main problem here is that school can take up too much of your time. Having to wake up early, do a ton of work,<br>
                arrive home late and do more work every day gets exhausting and students often dont have enough energy for anything else.<br>
                Another problem could be money and time, not everyone can afford to spend a lot of money and time is also an issue considering<br>
                that students need to do homework, study, and also hang out with friends. There is also the feeling that you started doing an activity <br>
                too late. If you want to start something, but you see someone much younger than you doing a lot better, it may make you lose confidence<br>
                or even quit
             </p>
         </div>
         <div class="footer">
            <p>Of course, taking extracurricular courses is a good oportunity to get into university and if someone has all the right <br>
            they should go, but at the same time not everyone can do that.</p>
